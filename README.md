i stareted this project cause my inability to fully grasp the full stack concepts , i could easily build a full stack appication with react and express or using next js but i didn't understand how things were working .After building this project i have grasped vague understanding of how the backend works 
[![progress-banner](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/http-server/f9295d9d-2915-419d-b7b0-748b008a9494)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)

This is a starting point for TypeScript solutions to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `bun (1.1)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.ts`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
